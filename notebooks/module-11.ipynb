    "Always encrypted encrypts sensitive data like credit card numbers or payroll information inside client-side applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always encrypted uses encryption keys and decryption policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always encrypted requires that you create **data encryption keys (DEK)** ahead of time. The DEKs are created at client-side using the Azure Comsos DB SDK. These DEKs are stored in the Azure Cosmos DB service. The DEKs are defined at the database level so they can be shared across multiple containers. Each DEK you create can be used to encrypt only one property, or can be used to encrypt many properties. You can have multiple DEKs per databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DEK must be wrapped by a **customer-managed key (CMK)** before it stored in Azure Cosmos DB. Since CMKs control the wrapping and unwrapping of the DEKs, they control the access to the data that is encrypted with those DEKs. CMK storage is designed as an extensible/plug-in model, with a default implementation that expects them to be stored in Azure Key Vault. The relationship between these components is displayed in the following diagram.\n",
